# CalculaTV - Can your TV compute? (Well, probably...)
#### A simple calculator build for The New ï£¿TV with the tvOS SDK.


### But what types of math problems?
Simple.
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

### Your code looks ugly!!111
I'm sorry! This is really the first thing I've built for tvOS- or really with Swift for that matter. I'm still learning.

### Theres an issue with something you've done.
You can help me fix it, or open a issue. GitHub has all kinds of tools!
